            <div class="content"><p>This is the night the darkness spoke to me. I heard whispers in the shadows--creeping up my jaw and crawling into my ear. The whispers murmured a raspy hiss. They compelled me to step forward through the blackness. I could not halt a step. I moved and moved, deeper into the void. I cannot hear else but the whisper. It pulled me onward--dark strings ripping from inside me. Endlessly tearing at my body--urging me to the edge. My final step never lands. I fall forward. I fall and fall. I lose sense of up and down. Am I still falling or am I ascending? It's getting harder to breathe. The air feels thick. Am I wet? I feel like I am slowing down. Am I underwater? I see a light. What is it. I feel scared for the first time. What is it. It's getting closer. So blurry. I strain my eyes to make out a shape. The light is rippling like water. What is it. My eyes. They hurt so badly. I feel my warm tears through the cold liquid around me. A little further. It's so bright. Almost there. What is it. The light. I feel warmth from it. I see my rippling reflection. I am so close to it. I am moving toward it so slowly now. So close. I can almost reach out and touch my reflection in the rippling light. Almost. My finger is about to touch its reflection. A flash. Blinding. So warm. What is it. But it's gone. The light. The warmth. The liquid around me. My reflection. Nothing. I am back at the beginning. Standing in the shadows. The dark strings tug me toward the edge once more. I couldn't break free again.</p></div>
